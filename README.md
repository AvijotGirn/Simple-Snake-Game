# Simple-Snake-Game
Created a very simple snake game to get a better understanding of Object Oriented Principles in Python, as well as modules such as Turtle. Also learned how to create a single executable file to run python scripts, and how to contain all necessary files into one "Application" file for distribution purposes (using NSIS).


# To Run
Download the file and open it. 
Follow Installation. 
Once installed, run **main.exe**
If you would like to move the executable file elsewhere, create a shortcut, and move the shortcut.
