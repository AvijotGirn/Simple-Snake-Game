# Simple-Snake-Game
Created a very simple snake game to get a better understanding of Object Oriented Principles in Python, as well as modules such as Turtle. Also learned how to create a single executable file to run python scripts, and how to contain all necessary files into one "Application" file for distribution purposes (using NSIS).

# IMPORTANT NOTE
This is not a full fleshed out game (i.e. some functionality missing such as restart button, and manual start button), because again, the main purpose was to learn about Python and creating executables.


# To Run
- Download the file and open it.
- Follow Installation.
- Once installed, run **main.exe**
- If you would like to move the executable file elsewhere, create a shortcut, and move the shortcut.
