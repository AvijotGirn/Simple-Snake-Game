# Simple-Snake-Game
Created a very simple snake game to get a better understanding of Object Oriented Principles in Python, as well as modules such as Turtle. Also learned how to create a single executable file to run python scripts, and how to contain all necessary files into one "Application" file for distribution purposes (using NSIS).
